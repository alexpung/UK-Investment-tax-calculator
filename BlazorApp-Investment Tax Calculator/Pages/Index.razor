        <h2 class="h4 mb-3">What this calculator does</h2>
        <p class="text-secondary">
            This application accepts broker statements (Interactive Brokers XML currently) and outputs taxable gains
            and losses according to UK trade matching rules. It also reports dividends and withholding tax paid by
            countries so you can complete SA106 and SA108 forms with clarity.
        </p>
        <p class="text-secondary">
            Your trade data never leaves your browser. The calculation is entirely client-side, protecting privacy
            while you model outcomes.
