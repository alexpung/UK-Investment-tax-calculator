        <h5>How to use this tool</h5>
        <p class="mb-1">Pick a Start and End date (use the "Unbounded" checkbox for open-ended ranges), select a residency status from the dropdown, then click 
            <em>Set residency for range</em>. Use <em>Reset</em> to clear the inputs. The timeline visualizes all configured ranges and the grid below lists them. To remove an entry, overwrite the time period with the updated status.</p>

        <h6 class="mt-2">Key terms</h6>
        <ul class="mb-0">
            <li><strong>Resident</strong>: the person is tax resident during the range; gains are generally subject to UK taxation for that period. This also includes the resident part of a split year treatment.</li>
            <li><strong>Temporary non-resident</strong>: a short-term non-residence period where different or transitional tax rules may apply; some disposals might still be taxed depending on timing. This also includes the non-resident part of a split year treatment.</li>
            <li><strong>Non-resident</strong>: the person is not tax resident during the range; UK capital gains tax may not apply to some assets or disposals while non‑resident (subject to specific rules). This also includes the non-resident part of a split year treatment.</li>
        </ul>

        <strong>Note:</strong> Decide whether a period should be marked <strong>Non‑resident</strong> or <strong>Temporary non‑resident</strong>.
        This tool does not determine residency status — choose the most appropriate option for your circumstances or consult a tax adviser.
